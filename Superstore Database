#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 

#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.

SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;

#Show a statistic about the item prices.

SELECT MAX (price)
FROM superstore;

#Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 

SELECT MAX (price)
FROM superstore 
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies'
ORDER BY price;
